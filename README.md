Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
